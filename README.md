# favorite_things_EXPRESS-NODE
This was made with Express and Node, initially it started as a RESTful API of my favorite books, foods, and albums. I passed the json through Express and used EJS to render the front-end. 

For the carousel, I used the [Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/) plugin to create the dragable carousel for each collection of items. 

Here's what the site looks like so far, live link coming soon!
